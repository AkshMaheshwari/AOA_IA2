# ♛ N Queens Problem Visual Simulation

A dynamic, interactive web-based simulation of the **N Queens problem**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project lets you visualize how backtracking is used to solve the classic N-Queens problem — complete with step-by-step animation, logs, and theme switching.


## 🧩 What is the N Queens Problem?

The N Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem that asks:  
> *How can N queens be placed on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other?*

This simulation uses **backtracking** to solve the problem and displays each queen's placement and the algorithm’s decision-making process visually.
